# Setting Up a WebDAV Server with Docker

WebDAV is a protocol that enables users to manage files on a remote server using standard HTTP methods. It's particularly useful for creating network drives or collaborative storage systems. Unlike FTP, WebDAV integrates seamlessly with most modern operating systems, allowing you to mount a server as if it were a local folder.

Using Docker to run a WebDAV server provides a clean, isolated environment thatâ€™s easy to set up and tear down. This is ideal for quick deployments or even long-term use when paired with persistent storage. The containerized approach removes the complexity of manual configuration and lets you focus on usage rather than setup.

WebDAV works great for personal cloud storage, internal backups, or as a file management layer between services. It's supported by various clients like GNOME Files, Windows Explorer, and tools like Cyberduck or Rclone. Once configured, it can be used across platforms without needing to install additional software on each client machine.

One common use case is mounting a WebDAV volume on a remote server and syncing data periodically. For instance, a backup script could upload daily logs to a WebDAV share, ensuring off-site safety. Another use case is sharing assets between team members on the same network without needing a full-fledged cloud provider.

Security should always be considered when exposing a WebDAV server to the internet. While Docker makes deployment easier, you should add authentication and HTTPS via a reverse proxy like NGINX or Caddy to ensure secure file transfers. Combining Docker with modern TLS provisioning (such as Let's Encrypt) makes WebDAV a viable option for secure remote storage.
