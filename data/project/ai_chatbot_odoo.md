# AI Chatbot with Odoo, LangChain & GraphQL

## üìå Overview
This project integrates an AI-powered chatbot into the **Odoo Community Edition** using **LangChain** and **GraphQL**, enabling intelligent tool-calling, multi-model LLM responses, and optimized backend performance.

A custom **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** was built to connect AI models with Odoo, allowing the chatbot to perform operations inside Odoo using tool calls.
